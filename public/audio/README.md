## Copyright Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Ensure you have the proper rights to use any audio files you place here. For commercial use or public hosting, use only:
- Royalty-free music
- Creative Commons licensed music
- Original compositions
- Music you have explicit permission to use

## Testing Your Audio

1. Place your audio file in this directory (named `birthday-theme.mp3`, `birthday-theme.wav`, or `birthday-theme.ogg`)
2. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the birthday invitation in your browser
4. Click anywhere on the page to enable audio (required by browsers)
5. Scroll down just 50 pixels and music will **automatically start playing**!

### No Audio File? No Problem!

If you don't have an audio file, the app will automatically use a built-in birthday melody created with Web Audio API. The music will still play when you scroll!

### Quick Test Audio Generation

1. Open your browser's developer console (F12)
2. Copy and paste this code:
   ```javascript
   // Copy the code from create-test-audio.js file
   const audioBuffer = createBirthdayAudio();
   downloadAudioBuffer(audioBuffer);
   ```
3. A `birthday-theme.wav` file will download
4. Place it in this `/public/audio/` directory

## Volume and Quality Tips

- Keep the volume moderate (the component defaults to 30% volume)
- Use upbeat, cheerful melodies suitable for children
- Avoid sudden loud sounds or jarring transitions
- Test on different devices and browsers
- Consider file size for mobile users
