# Baby Boss Audio Instructions

## Current Setup

The app is now configured to play **`the_baby_boss_2017.mp3`** - the perfect soundtrack for Neil Ezequiel's Baby Boss themed birthday!

## Quick Test

1. Place your `the_baby_boss_2017.mp3` file in this `/public/audio/` folder
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3001
4. Scroll down (even just a tiny bit)
5. You should hear the Baby Boss music! ðŸŽ§

## No Audio File?

If `the_baby_boss_2017.mp3` is not found, the app will play a built-in "Happy Birthday" melody as fallback.

## How to Change the Music

1. Find your Baby Boss soundtrack or any birthday song (MP3, WAV, or OGG format)
2. Rename it to: `the_baby_boss_2017.mp3` 
3. Place it in this `/public/audio/` folder
4. Refresh the page - your Baby Boss music will play!

## Current Implementation

- **Scroll trigger**: Music starts when you scroll more than 20 pixels
- **Auto-attempt**: Also tries to play after 1 second (might be blocked)
- **Fallback melody**: Built-in "Happy Birthday" tune if no file found
- **Visual feedback**: Shows status in top-right corner
- **Controls**: Play/pause and volume in bottom-right corner

## Troubleshooting

If no music plays at all:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Make sure you're scrolling (even a little bit)
4. Check if browser has audio blocked (look for speaker icon in URL bar)
